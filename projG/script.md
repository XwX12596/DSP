## Hydrogen

- hydrogen fuel cell technology
- batteries
- pollution and inefficiencies of the fossil fuel powered internal combustion engine
- 236 times as much energy per kg for hydrogen
- 8 times the price
- rapidly be refueled
- widely inefficient
- transport and storage

这个视频比较了氢能源和电能的优劣，主要从效率的角度分析了这两种能源在经济效益上的不同。其中，电能指的是大多数电动汽车使用的电池储能驱动电机；同时，氢能源指的是使用汽车上储存的氢气现场发电驱动电机。

首先，从能量密度上，氢能源取得完全胜利。同等重量的储能设备在满载的情况下，氢能源的储能密度是电能的两百倍以上；同时，从零开始到充能完成的时间也是氢能源完美胜利，这就导致氢能源的汽车在续航上能够有很大的优势。

但是，从经济角度上考虑，目前，氢能源因为生产和运输上存在技术限制，理论上的价格要比电能高上不少。此外，考虑到人工成本，实际用户使用时，每公里氢能源的价格将会是电能的八倍。

电能在现在社会和生态环境影响下，已经逐渐得到人们的喜爱。其受到欢迎的原因也许是减少污染，但是我一直很疑惑，这真的对环境有很大的帮助吗？我们可以从这个视频中看到，氢能源只是使用氢气作为能量搬运的媒介，需要在高品质能源到低品质能源的过程中耗散掉的能量是始终存在的。回到电动车上，我们知道现在火力发电厂仍然在大量使用，所以电动汽车追根究底还是使用的来自化石燃料的能量，除非完全使用清洁方式发电，否则电动汽车是不是能够被称作环保呢？

Under the influence of society and ecological environment, electric energy has gradually been loved by people. The reason for its popularity may be to reduce pollution, but I have always wondered whether it really helps the environment a lot? We can see from this video that hydrogen energy only uses hydrogen as the medium of energy transport, and the energy that needs to be dissipated in the process of high-quality energy to low-quality energy is always there. Back to electric vehicles, we know that thermal power plants are still using a lot of energy, so electric vehicles ultimately use energy from fossil fuels. Unless they completely use clean power generation, can electric vehicles be called environmental protection?

##  Quantum Computers

- superposition
- entanglement
- dies
- instant communication
- increased security
- good at things that a small input and output while having a vast array of possibilities
- limited by technology development

This video is talking about quantum computers. The most interesting thing of this topic is superposition and entanglement of the qubits. Superposition makes the qubits which contains information can express 2 different state in the same time, so the information $n$ qubits can contain is $2^n$, this will increase very rapidly while the number of qubits increases.

So, like the video maker says, quantum computers are good a things that a small input and output while having a vast array of possibilities. The advantage of quantum computers is that qubits are themselves possibility, so it is very easy for qubits to simulate possibilities of those particles.

Though quantum computers are strong, the working condition is too strict so that quantum computers are now unable to be widely used.

记得视频中有一句话，曾经经典计算机
