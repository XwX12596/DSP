## Bluetooth

- 123 $~\mathrm{mm}$

- invisible
- pass through obstructions
- $120.7~\mathrm{mm}$ represent 1
- $124.9 ~ \mathrm{mm}$ represent 0
- antenna
- a million times per second
- a Million Bits / Second
-  emit towards every direction
- perceive specific band of frequency

- $2.4 \sim 2.4835 ~ \mathrm{GHz}$
- $79$ Communication Channel, 2 frequencies to represent 0, 1

- ==packets==
- First 72 bits: Access Code to synchronize smartphone and earbuds to make sure that it's your specific earbuds that is that received the message. 
- Next 54 bits: Header --- for further information
- $136 \sim 8186$ bits: Payload decided by Header
- hopping around the 79 channels
- ==Frequency Hopping== Spread Spectrum
- prevent others from eavesdropping on the information
- Circuitry in your phone can generate pulses of electromagnetic waves a million times a second had very specific frequencies and then have these pulses received and decoded.
- ==Error Detection==
- ==Noise Filtering==
- reliable and secure
- Frequency-Shift Keying
- frequency called a carrier wave
- shift the carrier to a higher frequency when it wants to send a one or to a lower frequency when it wants to send zero
- Phase-Shift Keying
- Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
- time slot
- one by one
