## Spin Launch

- rocket equation
  - how much fuel a rocket needs to carry a payload to its destination

-   impart as much velocity as possible to the payload on the ground, eliminating as much fuel as possible from the rocket's weight
- To spin a small rocket in a centrifugal mass accelerator under vacuum up to an astonishing 
- 72 kilometers of altitude off nothing but pure kinetic energy
- carbon fiber
- make carbon fiber thick
- Mach 6
- tether is made of carbon fiber, it is thick and strong, support 100 million kilograms
- a loading of 10000G on the tether
- aeroshell 
- require a hefty piece of carbon composite with cross-sectional area of at least 0.23 meters squared
  - carbon fiber brick

- vacuum chamber
  - minimize drag and the power required to overcome it, minimize the aerodynamic heating that would destroy the tether, and eliminating all aerodynamics effects like flutter.

- 6000 dollars 
- SpaceX 6700 million dollars
  - 4100 dollars per kilogram
  - spin Launch 2500 dollars per kilogram

这男人捡到几个鹅蛋并将他们孵化出来养大，因为从小和他长大，这些鹅们总是会跟着这个男人。但是因为没有其他的同伴，这些鹅就不会自主地迁移，这个男人就想到应该由他，这些鹅的代理家长，带领他们前往迁移的目的地。为了完成这个目的，男人学会了开小型飞机，并对鹅们进行了训练，每次只要他一起飞，鹅们就会跟随着他共同在蓝天上飞翔，他也就这样展开了带领这群鹅迁移的故事。

路上，男人带领着这群鹅翻山越岭，在各种地方歇脚，比如湖泊，池塘，飞机场，沼泽，高尔夫场等等……最后到达了目的地，一片海边，男人和他的鹅群进行充分的告别后，离开了他们。从此，这群鹅也许就会自发地进行迁移，进行繁殖，建立自己的族群，成为野鹅的一份子。

男人之所以要保护这群鹅进行迁移，就是因为人类的扩张，猎杀导致野外的鹅越来越少，出于不想让这群鸟儿灭绝的心情，他倾尽心血保护鹅群的最终形态就是这轰轰烈烈的迁移学校。

The man picked up several goose eggs and hatched them and raised them. Because the geese grew up with him, they would always follow the man. But there was no other companion geese, the geese could not migrate independently. The man, the acting parent of the geese, thought that he should lead them to the destination of migration. In order to achieve this goal, the man learned to fly a small plane and trained the geese that every time he took off, the geese would follow him to fly together in the blue sky. Then he started the story of leading the geese to migrate.

On the way, the man led the group of geese to climb mountains and mountains and rest in various places, such as lakes, ponds, airports, marshes, golf courses, and so on. Finally, he arrived at the destination, a beach. The man said goodbye to his geese and left them. From then on, these geese should be able to independently migrate, breed, establish their own population, and become a part of wild geese.



The reason why a man wants to protect the geese for migration is that the expansion of human beings and hunting have led to fewer and fewer geese in the wild. Out of the mood that he does not want these birds to be extinct, he devotes himself to protecting the final form of the geese, which is this magnificent migration school.
