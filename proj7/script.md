## Mouse

- image sensor
- mice
- image acquisition system IAS
- infrared LED, a pair of lenses, and the image pixel array (image sensor)
- through a tiny aperture, hits image sensor (40x40 pixels)
- light only hits the tops of the hills and reflect
- the valleys remain dark
- 17,000 pictures of the surface every single second
- compares it to the previous on taken 59 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ earlier
- DSP, cross correlation algorithm
- $0 \sim 4095$ intensity of light
- SoC system on a chip
- DPI dots per inch
- move 2,000 units for every 1 inch of movement of the mouse
- DPI  is a linear unit
- interpolation, subpixel
- bilinear interpolation --- draw straight line
- report their movement to the computer 1000 times a second
- frame rate, reporting rate
