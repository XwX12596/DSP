# Pros and Cons

- ideal
- Easy to calculate
- no error
- Easy to reconstruct



- nonexistent signal
- waste of bandwidth

## Mouse

- image sensor
- mice
- image acquisition system IAS
- infrared LED, a pair of lenses, and the image pixel array (image sensor)
- through a tiny aperture, hits image sensor (40x40 pixels)
- light only hits the tops of the hills and reflect
- the valleys remain dark
- 17,000 pictures of the surface every single second
- compares it to the previous on taken 59 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ earlier
- DSP, cross correlation algorithm
- $0 \sim 4095$ intensity of light
- SoC system on a chip
- DPI dots per inch
- move 2,000 units for every 1 inch of movement of the mouse
- DPI  is a linear unit
- interpolation, subpixel
- bilinear interpolation --- draw straight line
- report their movement to the computer 1000 times a second
- frame rate, reporting rate

## Starch

- protein and calcium
- diet of human beings
- history
- the bulk of human beings
- live on starch-based diets, rice-based diets
- Throughout human history, all large successful populations of people have obtained the bulk of their calories from starch
- overweight, sickness
- children, military, poor people, our workers

## Our Planet

- polar regions/seas

- Antarctic

- `gentoo penguins`

- less than one percent of Antarctica is ice-free

- sea ice `algae`

- Antarctic `krill`

- `humpback whales`

  - ban on commercial whaling
  - food supply
  - with warming temperatures and disappearing sea ice, krill stocks in this part of the Southern Ocean have more than halved

- Orca

  - `killer whales`
  - top predators
  - hunting penguins
  - stealth mode

- From krill to killer whales, all life here ultimately depends upon Antarctica's sea ice

- These churning waters draw up nutrients from the deep, and create vast, rich fishing grounds for nomads like the wandering `albatross`.

- Beneath the waves, currents are flowing away from Antarctica, ==transporting nutrients== across the planet, fertilizing the oceans and helping to ==regulate global temperatures==.

### The island of South Georgia

- one year to grow and several years on sea

- He may well have been one of the many that die, entangled on longline fishing lines

- South Georgia is an ideal place for wanderers to raise their young, but now fewer adults are returning here to nest, and in recent years, the breeding population has declined by 40 percent.

- `Giant kelp` flourishes in these ==ice-free== waters

- `leopard seals` overwinter here to escape ==Antarctica's frozen ocean==

- seals stay longer for `king penguins`

- king penguins 

  - leopard seal

  - elephant seal
    - male fight for access of female
  - find their children

- All these creatures ultimately depend on the krill that develops under the sea ice around the Antarctic peninsula.

- With sea ice disappearing, so South Georgia's future is far from certain.

### Arctic

- polar bear
- seal
- walrus drop from high places
- He must eat two-thirds of the food he needs for the whole year before the ice melts and his hunting platform disappears.

- we're starting to lose one of our planet's protective white shields.
- For thousands of years, there's been a balance in the advance and retreat of the sea ice, but that is no longer the case.
- Today, during the summer months, there is 40 percent less sea ice cover than there was in 1980.

## Trajectory Recording

- cutting board
- move slow
- one block represent one unit
- because of height change
