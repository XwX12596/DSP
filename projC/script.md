# SDR

- noise
- TCXO 0.5PPM
- RTL (resistor-transistor logic) based

- sensitivity
- frequency range
- 1M 6G
- a little magnetic based telescopic antenna
  - not specially tuned

- Discore antenna
  - resonant on many bands
  -  outside
- vertical antenna
  - can be compact, resonant and wide band
- Magmount Car Antenna
  - mounted on car, window ledge, biscuit tin
  - not as good as an outside antenna

- Shortwave Sloper
  - wideband mainly for HF Below 30MHz
  - difficult to set up
  - coax

- SDR software
  - SDR Drivers

# IPv6

- more addresses
- 32 bits long to 128 bits long
- hexadecimal,} represent 4 bits
- network section and a host section
- ipv4 subnet mask
  - FE80::/10 represent highest 10bits of FE80
- :: for zeros, only once
- ignore unnecessary zeros
- every device can have its own IP address
- prefix
