- resurgence for analog technology
- no zeros and ones
-  two currents to represent two numbers 
- easy to do complex calculations
- not general-purpose computing devices
- continuous, don't know the exact value
- cannot repeat the calculation before
- error
- pros
  - powerful
  - fast
  - energy efficient
- cons
  - single-purpose
  - non-repeatable
  - inexact

- perceptron
  - neurons
  - how to train them

- auto-driving
- Alex-Net
  - size and depth, more layers and more units
  - GPU 

- perfect storm for analog computers
  - digital computers are reaching their limits
  - Neural networks are popular
  - matrix multiplications
  - lower requirement of precision

- Application

  - metaverse
  - analog computing
  - repurposed digital flash storage cells (memory)

  - FET with floating gate, the value of resister is p to the electrons
  - current = conductance $\times$ voltage, and add currents in on column 
  - do calculation in analog domain and do transmission in digital domain

  - digital may not be the end point of the IT

## New Brain Cells

- neurogenesis
- hippocampus
- important for learning, memory, mood and emotion
- new neurons in the hippocampus
- functions
  - learning and memory and aging and stress
  - capacity quality
- neurogenesis and depression

- neurogenesis is a target of choice

- eat sport

- moving the blood flow to the brain

## Jungle

- tropical forest
  - cool the earth
- Congo's rainforest
- clearings
- 沼泽森林
- called bai
- no poaching
- seed dispersers
- second-largest rainforest
- New Guinea
- orangutan
  - declined by 75%
- ideas
  - poaching
  - learn to be grown up
  - ants and cordyceps
