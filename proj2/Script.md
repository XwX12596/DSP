### Chip  Making

这个视频向我们详细介绍了一个小芯片是怎样从沙子里面的硅中诞生的。首先，硅是半导体，不含有我们所谓的导电所需的自由电子或者空穴，所以不能让它在某种特定的情况下拥有像良导体一样的特性。所以我们使用在元素周期表中相近的非金属元素的硼和磷所谓掺杂物，使得混合物中拥有自由电子或者空穴，从而形成P型或者N型导体，进而制成单向导电的PN结。

有了PN结，我们就可以制造BJT或者MOS管。而其中的MOS管被我们大量用来制造芯片。其原理可以被阐述为：在栅极加上高电平或者加上低电平，此时在漏极和源极之间所加的电压就可以在管子内形成所对应的掺杂区通道成功形成电流，而不是受限于PN结的反向特性。

通过数字电路及其逻辑设计的发展，我们可以在理论上获得一个芯片的设计图，要做的事情就是将它制造出来。

而在视频中展示出来的是芯片工厂的人在无尘室内通过复杂的工艺最终制成一大块芯片板，最终通过封装得到一个个小芯片。

This video shows us in detail how a small chip is born from silicon in the sand. First of all, silicon is a semiconductor, which does not contain the free electrons or holes, so it cannot behave like what we need. So we use the so-called dopants of boron and phosphorus, which are near silicon in the periodic table of elements and are non-metallic elements to make the mixture have free electrons or holes, so as to form p-type or n-type conductors, and then make the unidirectional conductive PN junction.

With the PN junction, we can make BJT or MOSFET. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in digital circuits, as billions may be included in a memory chip or microprocessor. [1] How MOSFETs work can be described as: a high level or a low level is applied to the grid. At this time, the voltage applied between the drain and the source can form the corresponding doped conductive channel in the tube to successfully form the current, rather than being limited by the reverse conducting PN junction.

With the development of digital circuits and its logic design, we can theoretically construct a chip's design chart, and what we need to do is to make it.

What is shown in the video is that people in the chip factory finally make a large chip board through complex processes in a clean room, and finally get small chips through encapsulation.

So, after watching this video, I can understand how the chips are theoretically constructed. But, I can barely understand the process that how the chips are manufactured in the clean room, so I guess it's just too complex. 

However, we will need more and more chips like those mentioned in this video, which means more effort should be made in the future.

### New Black Hole

这个视频所告诉我们的就是关于我们通过努力再一次捕捉到了黑洞的身影，从而进一步推进我们关于黑洞的了解与研究。

首先，拍到这张相片的意义在于，我们能够更加清楚地明白，第一次所拍到的照片中的物体确实是黑洞，而且黑洞在我们的观测手段中的长相也得到了进一步证实。

其次，通过理论证实，想要使用望远镜拍到此次的黑洞照片，其直径至少在地球半径级别，所以我们采用了EHT。

An international team of astronomers led by scientists at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian who produced the first direct image of a black hole three years ago have now produced a portrait of a second, this time a much-anticipated glimpse of one at the heart of the Milky Way.[2]

And this video is about this news about our second capture of the trace of black holes, thus further promoting our understanding and research.

First, the significance of taking this photo is that we can understand more clearly that the object in the first photo is indeed a black hole, and the appearance of a black hole in our observation has been further confirmed.

Secondly, through theoretical confirmation, if we want to take this black hole picture with a telescope, its diameter must be at least at the level of the earth's radius, so we adopted the EHT. 

By linking together existing telescopes using new systems, the EHT creates a fundamentally new instrument with angular resolving power that is the highest possible from the surface of the Earth.

## color distinguish

Colors refer to the frequency of the light wave which is kind of electromagnetic wave. But not all frequency bands of electromagnetic waves can be perceived by the eyes, and the frequency range of visible light is about $830 - 750~\mathrm{THz} ~\sim ~ 395 - 360 ~\mathrm{THz}$.

So, the first thing we should do is to find out how our eyes receive and distinguish the colors. Humans normally have three types of cones, usually designated L, M and S for long, medium and short wavelengths respectively.\cite{} The three types of cones cannot distinguish every single color, there always are two color that are too close to tell. So I guess there are many bands which cones can receive, and colors in one band can only be interpreted to certain color in this band, like we all do in sampling and quantification.

Then, we should find out the smallest difference which our eyes can tell---so-call the bandwidth. Here comes the problem, we can't make sure whether the bands are linearly placed in all frequency, so a detailed experiment is required. In this experiment, we need only one kind of cones can receive the light --- Perhaps we can use only short wavelengths light to test the S cones. I don't know whether this works, but I want to continue my thought experiment--- then choose hundreds of lights, let the participants tell the difference between two colors in an area while narrowing the gap of frequency until he or she cannot distinguish, and go to another area. So we can calculate how many colors can people distinguish in one area, and after adding them all, we will get the number that one kind of cones can tell. The number our eyes can distinguish is the 3rd power of that number.

Through searching on the Internet, I know that 100 is the most colors we can see with one kind of cones. So, at all we can see 1,000,000 of colors with our eyes.

## Mood

Individual mood is an affective state that is important for physical and emotional well-being, working memory, creativity, decision-making, and immune response. Mood is influenced by levels of dopamine, serotonin, and other neurochemicals, as well as by levels of hormones. Mood is also externally modified by social activity, such as daily routines of work, commuting, and eating. Because of this complexity, accurate measurement of affective rhythms at the individual level has proven elusive. \cite{mood_sci}

## Proposal

### How we can hear the music through electronic equipment and what is 'Hi-Fi'

首先，我会通过分析理论和硬件两个方面的问题，探究声音信息到底是如何从声带的振动开始，走到我们的扬声器，最终让听者接收到信息的。

然后，我会主要关于采样，数模转换，功率放大等方面探究目前市场上的昂贵器件在日常音乐欣赏中是否必要的问题，以及为何各大音乐平台强调类似'flac'这样的'无损音乐文件格式'这个概念的原因。

最后，关于这个提案的来源，其实是我在上大学之前曾经以外行人的身份接触过上述器件，并在完全不了解其原理的情况下购买了其中的某些硬件。我会在文章中阐述我现在的音频解决方案，并且用新得到的知识评估这套方案。

First of all, I will explore how the sound information starts from the vibration of the vocal cords, goes to our speakers in terms of theory and hardware, and finally allows the listener to receive the information.

Then, I will purposely explore whether expensive devices on the market are necessary in daily music appreciation from sampling, DAC, power amplification and other aspects, and why major music platforms emphasize the concept of 'lossless music file format' such as 'FLAC'.

Finally, the reason for this proposal is that I have learned about the above-mentioned devices without any knowledge of electronic engineering and purchased some of the hardware without understanding the principle. I will introduce my current desktop audio solution in the article and evaluate it with my newly acquired knowledge.
