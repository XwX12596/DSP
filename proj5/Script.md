  - centenarian has the basis of their diet as beans
  - plant-based

- exercise
  - endorphins -- good happy chemicals
  - serotonin neuropathy and dopamine
  - depression Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease
- water
  - 70 percent of our body is water, 80 percent of our brains are made of components that are water
  - tryptophan is a substance that if it reaches the brain to good proportions will allow you to secrete more serotonin
  - these things that you consume and these nutrients to travel to the brain
  - the more water the more tryptophan goes to the brain, the more raw material we have to generate serotonin and the happier you become
  - great clarity in your mind
- sunshine
  - sleep will be sounder
  - decrease the pain someone has


- temperance
  - cigarettes
  - alcohol
  - coffee

- air
  - oxygen cleanses your blood which will come to your brain
    - neurotransmitters

- rest
  - outcome driven
  - push so much
  - mind clarity
- trust
  - the greatest need of this world is that of people who stand for the truth as the needle of a compass to the pole. It is the need of the world to have people who extend strong to principle even though the heavens fall
  - put others down
  - make a commitment
  - love
  - like-minded
  - regularly meet





- Actively participate in exercise will definitely contribute to achieving an optimal mental health that will set you and the community above the average and will reduce visits to people like me
- water is so important seventy percent of our bodies are made out of water
- people who do not consume enough water become more frustrated they have less clarity of mind and then it will affect as a default your mental health performance
- certain habits and behaviors that will provoke and will allow you to have a better mental health performance

# Mental Health

This lecture want to tell us what is important to improve our mental health. There are 8 principles the speaker mentioned.

1. nutrition

The research shows that those whose norm was to achieve 100 years or older had the basis of their diet plant-based.

1. exercise

Exercise help our body produce good happy chemicals.

1. water

70 percent of our body is water. Water helps to travel nutrients to our brain which are the raw materials of the chemicals mentioned above, and then helps you to become happy.

1. sunshine

The sunshine make our sleep sounder, and decrease the pain someone has.

1. temperance

Don't use too much cigarettes, alcohol and coffee.

1. air

Help clarify our blood.

1. rest

This world is almost outcome driven, we all want to do much better. But, in the process of pushing ourselves ,we often underestimate the effect of rest and overestimate the effect of the time we spent.

1. trust

> The greatest need of this world is that of people who stand for the truth as the needle of a compass to the pole. It is the need of the world to have people who extend strong to principle even though the heavens fall

Nowadays, many people have lost in the competition with others and  have given up the basic trust between people around them.

What we should treasure is the pure thoughts we had once we were a baby. In this video, such as, love and trust.

# Our Planet

This video shows us the beautiful scenes of shallow seas in earth and the danger of the animals and plants in those areas face.

We human's activities have been effecting the balance of the shallow seas which are the habitat of the living things. 

One is the emitting of $CO_2$ , which is one of the results of global warming. In this video, the little change will let the coral get white and die.

The other is fishing. Over fishing break the food chain in the ecological system, which will lead to, in this video, sea urchins falling the kelp forests.

Thankfully, we human have taken action to prevent the bad things from happening. The seas around Misool, mentioned in the last part of this video, has been set as a protected area. In a decade, the vivid scene recovered, and this gives us confidence to make other areas vivid again.

# New Fuel

First, this video makes a comparison between the hydrogen, the kerosene and methane.

The hydrogen has good performance as fuel. It can give more impulse with less mass. But it is hard to store because the small density of itself.

The kerosene is easier to store than hydrogen, but the problem is that it cannot be fully burn (into carbon dioxide and water). This makes the residue which is solid have the change of getting stuck in the engine.

The methane achieve the balance of the two fuels. But also that means methane doesn't have the best effect in every area.

The goodness of the methane is that it can be synthesized from $CO_2$. Also, the raw material of this chemical reaction which is carbon dioxide is easy to get on Mars. And if we can get $H_2O$ on Mars, this reaction can even provide excess of oxygen for human breathing. This extra bonus helps us make human settlement in the future.

The scientists are now developing a new technology which can better solve the energy problem on Mars. Moreover, carbon capture on Earth is more to look forward to. If we can improve the efficiency of the reaction which change the carbon dioxide to methane, a clean renewable way of consuming the energy can be found.
