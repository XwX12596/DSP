This video is basically about how beautiful our planet is and the truth that we are breaking its stability.

Like how our human social works, the nature has its our system and every single pieces of our beautiful planet are firmly connected. For example, the sea water evaporates at all times. The water vapor full of air will always condensates into drops, and fall from the air in the form of rain at one time. This is the natural water cycle, and the strong proof of the internal connection of nature.

What we are doing is making our planet warmer and warmer, and one of the results is the melting of glaciers. The fresh water from the glaciers will disturb the sea's current, change the salinity, and eventually affect the nature ecology.

The nature is more complex than what we thought. The rapid development of mankind from last century has been damaging the health of our only Mother Earth. Just as somebody says, 'We're the first generation to know what we're doing, and the last who have a chance to put things right'. There definitely are something which must be preserved if we are to ensure a future where humans and nature can thrive.

# Earbuds

>  always remember to consider the conceptual simplicity, yet structural complexity in the world around you.

This video do the 4 things below:

1. Earbuds Disassembly and Introduction to Every Module in the Earbuds
2. Discuss the Audio Codec
3. Sampling Rate and Bit-depth
4. Music File Formats

For wired headphones, electricity flows from our smartphones through the wires to the headphones. In the wire, there's only analog signals travel between the smartphone and the headphone. However, for wireless earbuds, this doesn't work because it's difficult to send analog signals to such a tiny thing through the channel of air. The AirPods 2 relies on the technology of Bluetooth, DAC and the theory of the speaker to provide its service. 

About the audio codec, codec stands for coding and decoding. In playing music, codec do the decoding, which means it converts the music data from digital values to analog waves. So, the coding means the reverse of that process.

We were talking about the sampling rate last week, and that's how we make continuous waves into a set of discrete pulses. The most common rate is $44.1~\mathrm{kHz}$, and the second popular one is $48~\mathrm{kHz}$.

However, we cannot save the pulses with irrational size as binary, so we must do the quantization -- making all numbers in an interval fall into the center point (or other certain points) of this interval. The bit-depth is the number how many binary numbers (this also means how many levels do we have in the process of quantization) we use to represent one pulse.

Audio File Format can be divided into lossy format and lossless format according to whether part of the original audio data will be deleted. MP3 and AAC is a common lossy format, and their algorithm will find and delete the part of the original audio data that is hard for human ears to detect. ALAC and FLAC are common lossless formats. They only compress the original audio data in use of lossless compression algorithm and don't delete any original data.

The wireless earbuds is everywhere in our life. Maybe we all know that the sound is wave and the earbuds are just the processer of them, but few of us try to know about how pratically this tiny thing works. So, keep curiosity is crucial.

# Benefit of Exercise

In this TED talks, we are suggested to do the proper amount of the exercise to improve our brain.

Our brains are get older while our bodies are getting older, especially Hippocampus, this talker mentioned. But we do have ways to slow that process -- exercise.

She, the talker, experienced the change exercise gives her and her brain, so she shifted the goal of her lab and find out a new way to make or just keep people's minds brilliant. 

Now, she's going to find out what the most proper amount of exercise of one specific person, and I think this means a lot for those who sit before their computers all day long.

Saying goes, life lies in sports, and we all know it. What's more, people today are clever enough to find out the most complex relationship between 'life' and 'sports'.

I will show you what I know from my campus survey. If you want to see the original survey data, please see the file of research.csv.

## Results

|             | Daily   | Weekly             |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Most Happy  | Evening | Friday or Saturday |
| Least Happy | Morning | Monday             |

## Questions

I will answer your questions in this section. Due to space barriers, the survey source data that cannot be fully displayed will be displayed in the attached research.csv file.

### What school can do?

I'd like to introduce to you what schools can do to improve our campus life, as I saw in the survey results.

#### 时间管理

我们能看到在调查中有在夜晚最快乐或者在周末最快乐的，但是同时面临着学业上的问题的一些学生。我认为造成这样的原因有二：1.这位学生的课程安排过于紧张，导致其在工作日无法得到很好的休息。同时，所积累的疲劳也会在这个时候累积，导致出现精力不足，在学业上很吃力的问题;2.这位学生平时做事拖拖拉拉，在工作日学习上怠惰，导致上课失去兴致，进而渴望放假时间休息。

对于这样的学生，我们可以由辅导员给他建议，以解决他学业上的问题，提高其学习效率，使其从容地面对繁重的学业。

We can see that in the survey, there are some students who are happiest at night or at weekends, but also face academic problems. I think there are two reasons for this: 1. The student's curriculum arrangement is too tight, which makes him unable to get a good rest in the working day. At the same time, the accumulated fatigue will also accumulate at this time, leading to the problem of lack of energy and academic difficulty; 2. The student usually procrastinates and is lazy in studying on weekdays, which leads to the loss of interest in class and the desire to have a rest during the holidays.

For such students, we can ask counselors to give them suggestions to solve their academic problems, improve their learning efficiency, and make them calmly face the heavy study.

#### 校内帮助

在问卷中有关于情绪和近日困扰的调查，这是为了判断答卷人是否存在心理卫生或者人生困惑上的问题。

由于学习压力，家庭变故等原因，学生有可能在生活中产生过多的不良情绪，如果不进行排解，会导致心理问题。这时我们就应该发挥校内帮助组织的作用，给予充足的心理疏导。

另一方面，在规划自己人生上有困难的学生还应该获得职业规划中心的额外帮助。

In the questionnaire, there is a survey on emotions and recent troubles, which is to judge whether the respondents have mental health or life problems.



Due to learning pressure, family changes and other reasons, students may have too many bad emotions in their lives. If they do not solve them, they will have psychological problems. At this time, we should give full play to the role of the school's help organization and give adequate psychological guidance.



On the other hand, students who have difficulties in planning their own lives should also receive additional help from the Career Planning Center.

#### 课业辅导

问卷中可以看出，有比起休息日更喜欢工作日，且喜欢早晨而不喜欢夜晚，但是却认为学业是他们的困难的学生，这说明他们是倾向于热爱学习并能很好规划自己时间的，但仍然觉得所学知识的量或者所学知识的难度是他们的困扰所在。

对于这样的问题，学校可以做好通知，让每一个学生都能知道怎样抓住每一个和任课老师沟通的机会。

t can be seen from the questionnaire that some students prefer working days to rest days, prefer morning to night, but think that their studies are difficult. This shows that they tend to love learning and can plan their time well, but still feel that the amount of knowledge they have learned or the difficulty of learning is their trouble.



For such problems, the school can make a good notice so that every student can know how to seize every opportunity to communicate with the teacher.

#### 结论

在数据表格（research.csv）中，我根据自己的认知判断出参与调查的学生可能需要上面哪种帮助，然后标在了数据后（0表示这位学生的生活相对比较快乐）。

可以看出需要校内组织进行帮助的学生会相对多一些，学校可以根据这一点重点改善在校学生对于心理健康中心和职业规划中心的了解。

In the data table (research. csv), I judged which help the students participating in the survey might need according to my own cognition, and then marked it after the data (0 means the student's life is relatively happy).



It can be seen that there are relatively many student associations that need help from the school organization. The school can focus on improving the students' understanding of the mental health center and the career planning center according to this.

### Other meaningful results

1. 觉得难以控制自己情绪的学生都拥有恋爱困扰Students who find it difficult to control their emotions have love problems
2. 觉得学业繁重的学生大多喜欢早晨和夜晚Most of the students who feel that their studies are heavy like morning and night

### code

在我的计划里，我将使用Python建立一个简单的机器学习模型。然而，使用Python处理中文是一件非常困难的事情，所以我将问卷中的单选题的选项都使用整数代替了。这个过程将充分使用Excel的查找功能并且十分无趣，所以它将不会出现在我的报告里。

我在看完第一个视频后对这个视频配套的网站产生了兴趣，并在上面看到了许多保护地球的简单方法，有拒绝塑料袋，低碳出行这些早就被提出的方法，也有一些新的方法，如果能让更多人知道并践行这些小诀窍，这个纪录片也就达成了它的很重要的使命了。

第二个视频中无线耳机的原理是我一直想要了解的。

第三个视频中这位talker的想法很令人振奋，让人想要立刻去做一些运动，这种活力正是我们需要的。



在热力图（附录）中可以看出在报告中的结果还不尽人意，如果能够有更大数量的数据，并且有足够多的时间去处理这些数据，我们将得到一个一劳永逸的判断学生是否需要学校帮助的模型。

我们在从前的学习中学习过这些知识，但有些已经忘记，需要再次巩固，证明公式不失是一个好方法。
